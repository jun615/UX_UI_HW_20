        <img class="intropic" src="images/for.jpg" width="600px" height="400px">
        <p class="intro">Friends of Refugees, founded in 2005, is a non-profit organization dedicated to
            helping
            refugees resettle in America. Located in Clarkston, GA, Friends of Refugees' mission is to empower refugees
            through opportunities that provide for their well-being, education, and employment.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="intro2">Over the course of three weeks, our group will be conducting a responsive website redesign to
            provide
            stakeholderes, fmailies, and volunteers a clean, easy-to-use website that will evoke a feeling of safety,
            community, and inclusion.</p>
        <h2 class="theproblem">The Problem</h2>
        <div class="theProblem">We have observed that users, both first-time and long-time volunteers, often struggle to
            locate pertinent
            information regarding statistics, funding, or volunteering due to excessive copy or organizational issues,
            potentially determining their future involvement within that organization.</div>

    <div class="jumbotron1">
        <h1 class="display-5">The Research</h1>

        <h2 class="interview">Interview</h2>

        <img class="intpic" src="images/int.jpg" width="800px" height="500px">
        <p class="int-1">To begin the research process, we started by interviewing users who had experience volunteering
            with
            non-profits in the past or interested in volunteering. We asked questions that would help us discover what
            components of the website would hold the most value to a user. We discovered that the mission of the
            non-profit was important - as many users wanted validation that the non-profit was truly living out their
            cause and deliving on their promise.
        </p>

        <h2 class="affinity">Affinity Diagram</h2>
        <img class="affpic" src="images/affinity.jpg" width="800px" height="500px">
        <p class="aff-1">One of the research methods we utilized was the affinity diagram. With the data we
            collected from the interviews, we were able to group similiar answers to help us draw a bigger picture.
            This process gave us: greater insight to what our users need out of the website, pointed out the areas of
            opportunity to make revisions, and guided us throughout the redesign process to enhance the user experience.
        </p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p class="aff-2">Based off of the different groupings, the team and I brainstormed together to draft up ideas
            and prepare us for the next step of our research phase.</p>

        <h2 class="persona">User Persona</h2>
        <img class="jose" src="images/Persona.jpg" width="800px" height="500px">
        <p class="pers-1">With the research conducted, we were able to create our user persona to understand who our
            user is and to allow us to empathize with them throughout the design process. We gathered some valuable
            insight which guided us throughout the project and influenced our design process. </p>

        <img class="sketchpic" src="images/sketch.jpg" width="800px" height="500px">
        <p class="sketch-1">To begin the wireframe, we started with a sketch for the redesign. The three team members
            each drafted their own sketch of what our new webiste will look like and merged our ideas together. We were
            able to draw inspiration from the current website as well as what the "competitors" were displaying on their
            websites. </p>
